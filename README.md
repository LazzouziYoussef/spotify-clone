A full-stack Spotify Clone application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This project serves as a learning ground for modern web technologies including React 19, Express 5, and real-time data handling.

## 🚧 Current Status

The project is currently in the **Initial Setup / Skeleton** phase.

### ✅ Implemented

- **Project Architecture:** Monorepo-style structure separating `frontend` and `backend`.
- **Authentication Setup:** Integration with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for secure user management with protected routes and OAuth flow. The `authProvider` component wraps the application and sets the authorization header for all axios requests.
- **Backend Routing:** Route handlers established for Users, Songs, Albums, Admin functions, and Stats.
- **Database Connection:** MongoDB connection logic and Mongoose models (User, Song, Album, Message).
- **Frontend Foundation:** Vite + React + TypeScript setup with Tailwind CSS 4 configuration.
- **Frontend Routing:** Client-side routing with React Router for page navigation and OAuth callbacks.
- **API Communication:** Axios integration for making API requests to the backend.
- **UI Components:** 
    - `TopBar` with navigation, `SignInOAuthButton` for Google OAuth authentication.
    - `Button` and `Card` components in the `ui` directory.
    - **New:** `MainLayout` using `react-resizable-panels` for a responsive, Spotify-like interface with resizable sidebars.
- **File Upload System:** Integration with `express-fileupload` for handling audio and image uploads.
- **Cloudinary Integration:** Media hosting for song audio files and album artwork.
- **Admin Functionality:** 
    - Admin routes for creating and deleting songs and albums with proper authorization.
    - The `isAdmin` check in `TopBar.tsx` is currently hardcoded to `false`.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling middleware for production-ready responses.
- **CORS:** Enabled for `http://localhost:3000` to allow frontend to communicate with the backend.
- **Song Fetching:** The home page fetches featured, "made for you", and trending songs from the backend.
- **Database Seeding:** Scripts to populate the database with initial songs and albums.

### 📅 Planned Features

- [ ] Full Music Playback & Streaming
- [ ] Admin Dashboard UI for Content Management
- [ ] Real-time Socket.io events (currently stubbed)
- [x] User Playlists & Likes (Backend routes created)
- [ ] Search and Filtering

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/callback` - Handle Clerk OAuth callback and sync user to the database.

### Songs

- `GET /api/songs` - Get all songs
- `GET /api/songs/featured` - Get featured songs (6 random songs)
- `GET /api/songs/made-for-you` - Get personalized songs (4 random songs)
- `GET /api/songs/trending` - Get trending songs (4 random songs)
- `GET /api/songs/:id` - Get a song by its ID.

### Albums

- `GET /api/albums` - Get all albums
- `GET /api/albums/:AlbumId` - Get album by ID with songs

### Admin

- `POST /api/admin/songs` - Create new song (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/songs/:id` - Delete song (Admin only)
- `POST /api/admin/albums` - Create new album (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/albums/:id` - Delete album (Admin only)
- `GET /api/admin/check` - Check admin status

### Users

- `GET /api/users` - Get all users except current user (Authenticated)

### Playlists

- `POST /api/users/playlist` - Create a new playlist
- `GET /api/users/playlists` - Get all playlists
- `GET /api/users/playlists/:PlaylistId` - Get playlist by ID

### Stats

- `GET /api/stats` - Get platform statistics including songs, users, albums, and unique artists count (Admin only)

## Frontend Architecture

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" (`SignInOAuthButton`).
2. Clerk redirects to Google OAuth.
3. OAuth callback redirects to `/sso-callback`.
4. Final redirect to `/auth-callback` with Clerk token.
5. `AuthCallBackPage` syncs the user with the backend via a `POST` request to `/api/auth/callback`.
6. The `authProvider` component wraps the application and sets the authorization header for all axios requests using the token from Clerk.
7. API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Client-Side Routing

- `/` - `HomePage` wrapped in `MainLayout`.
- `/chat` - `ChatPage` wrapped in `MainLayout` (placeholder).
- `/sso-callback` - Clerk OAuth redirect handler.
- `/auth-callback` - `AuthCallBackPage` for token extraction and user synchronization.
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (planned, only accessible to admins).

### Key Components

- **MainLayout:** The core application wrapper providing the resizable 3-pane layout (Sidebar, Content, Friends).
- **TopBar:** Navigation bar with admin link (currently hardcoded to not show), sign in/out buttons.
- **SignInOAuthButton:** Google OAuth integration with Clerk.
- **authProvider:** A component that wraps the application and sets the authorization header for axios requests.
- **Axios Instance:** Pre-configured HTTP client with baseURL (`http://localhost:8080/api`).
- **UI System:** Built with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS (`Button`, `Card`, `Resizable`, `ScrollArea`).
